# JavaScript Series

A series to learn the JavaScript basics. Everything runs completely in the browser.

All parts of this series will run from a single web page, however the course will not be focused on web development specifically. This is simply the lowest-barrier of starting to learn: (a) get into the language mechanics, (b) avoid extra dependencies on outside tooling (e.g. Node.js).

This series is best explored on a device where you can comfortably use the browser's Developer Tools.


## Table of Contents

### Ex. 1-1 Let's run JavaScript in an HTML file

- JavaScript runs in the browser...along with HTML and CSS

    - A for-loop printing each item of the array
